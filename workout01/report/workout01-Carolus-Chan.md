It is the ultimate win condition in basketball to be the team that makes the most baskets in a given game. It is no wonder that basketball players are evaluated heavily on the shots make whether it be 2pt, 3pt, of free throw shots. The Golden States Warriors (GSW) is arguably the best team as of the last few years. Here, we take a look at some stats of shots made of the 5 players from the GSW in the 2016 season.
